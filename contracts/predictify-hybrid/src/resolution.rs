/// Resolution management system for Predictify Hybrid contract
///
/// This module provides a comprehensive resolution system with:
/// - Oracle resolution functions and utilities
/// - Market resolution logic and validation
/// - Resolution analytics and statistics
/// - Resolution helper utilities and testing functions
/// - Resolution state management and tracking

// ===== RESOLUTION TYPES =====

/// Enumeration of possible resolution states for market lifecycle management.
///
/// This enum tracks the progression of a market through its resolution phases,
/// from initial creation through final outcome determination. Each state represents
/// a specific stage in the resolution process with distinct validation rules and
/// available operations.
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// The typical resolution flow follows this pattern:
/// ```text
/// Active → OracleResolved → MarketResolved → [Disputed] → Finalized
/// ```
///
/// **Alternative flows:**
/// - Direct admin resolution: `Active → MarketResolved → Finalized`
/// - Dispute flow: `MarketResolved → Disputed → Finalized`
/// - Oracle-only flow: `Active → OracleResolved → MarketResolved → Finalized`
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Symbol};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::{ResolutionState, ResolutionUtils};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::markets::Market;
/// # let env = Env::default();
/// # let market = Market::default(); // Placeholder
///
/// // Check current resolution state
/// let current_state = ResolutionUtils::get_resolution_state(&env, &market);
///
/// match current_state {
///     ResolutionState::Active => {
///         println!("Market is active, ready for oracle resolution");
///         // Can fetch oracle results
///     },
///     ResolutionState::OracleResolved => {
///         println!("Oracle result available, can proceed to market resolution");
///         // Can combine with community consensus
///     },
///     ResolutionState::MarketResolved => {
///         println!("Market resolved, awaiting finalization or disputes");
///         // Can be disputed or finalized
///     },
///     ResolutionState::Disputed => {
///         println!("Resolution is under dispute");
///         // Dispute resolution process active
///     },
///     ResolutionState::Finalized => {
///         println!("Resolution is final and immutable");
///         // No further changes allowed
///     },
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # State Validation
///
/// Each state has specific validation requirements:
/// - **Active**: Market must be within voting period
/// - **OracleResolved**: Oracle data must be valid and recent
/// - **MarketResolved**: Final outcome must be determined
/// - **Disputed**: Dispute must be properly filed and active
/// - **Finalized**: Resolution must be complete and immutable
///
/// # Business Rules
///
/// State transitions enforce business logic:
/// - Markets cannot skip resolution states arbitrarily
/// - Finalized resolutions cannot be changed
/// - Disputed resolutions require proper dispute resolution
/// - Oracle resolution requires valid oracle data
///
/// # Integration Points
///
/// Resolution states integrate with:
/// - **Market Management**: Controls available market operations
/// - **Voting System**: Determines when voting periods end
/// - **Dispute System**: Manages dispute lifecycle
/// - **Oracle System**: Coordinates oracle data fetching
/// - **Admin Functions**: Enables administrative overrides

/// # Core Components
///
/// **Market Context:**

///
/// The oracle resolution evaluates market conditions:
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, String};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::oracles::OracleUtils;
/// # let env = Env::default();
///
/// // Example: BTC above $50,000?

/// let outcome = OracleUtils::determine_outcome(
///     btc_price,
///     threshold,
///     &comparison,

/// )?;
///
/// assert_eq!(outcome, String::from_str(&env, "yes")); // BTC > $50k = "yes"
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Validation Requirements
///
/// Oracle resolutions must meet criteria:
/// - **Valid Price**: Price must be positive and within reasonable bounds
/// - **Recent Data**: Timestamp must be within acceptable staleness limits
/// - **Supported Provider**: Oracle provider must be supported on current network
/// - **Valid Feed**: Feed ID must exist and be active
/// - **Proper Comparison**: Comparison operator must be supported
///
/// # Integration with Market Resolution
///
/// Oracle resolutions feed into broader market resolution:
/// - **Hybrid Resolution**: Combined with community consensus
/// - **Oracle-Only**: Used directly as final outcome
/// - **Dispute Input**: Provides data for dispute resolution
/// - **Confidence Scoring**: Contributes to overall resolution confidence

// ===== ORACLE RESOLUTION =====

/// Comprehensive oracle resolution management system for prediction markets.
///
/// The Oracle Resolution Manager handles all aspects of oracle-based market resolution,
/// including fetching oracle data, validating oracle responses, calculating confidence
/// scores, and managing the oracle resolution lifecycle. It serves as the primary
/// interface between the prediction market system and external oracle providers.
///
/// # Core Responsibilities
///
/// **Oracle Data Management:**
/// - **Data Fetching**: Retrieve price data from configured oracle providers
/// - **Data Validation**: Ensure oracle responses meet quality standards
/// - **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate reliability scores for oracle data
/// - **Error Handling**: Manage oracle failures and fallback strategies
///
/// **Market Integration:**
/// - **Market Validation**: Ensure markets are ready for oracle resolution
/// - **Outcome Determination**: Convert oracle data to market outcomes
/// - **Resolution Storage**: Persist oracle resolution results
/// - **Event Emission**: Notify system of oracle resolution events
///
/// # Oracle Resolution Process
///
/// The typical oracle resolution workflow:
/// ```text
/// 1. Validate Market → 2. Fetch Oracle Data → 3. Validate Response →
/// 4. Calculate Outcome → 5. Score Confidence → 6. Store Resolution
/// ```
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Symbol, Address};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::{OracleResolutionManager, OracleResolution};
/// # let env = Env::default();
/// # let market_id = Symbol::new(&env, "btc_50k_market");
/// # let oracle_contract = Address::generate(&env);
///
/// // Fetch oracle resolution for a market
/// let oracle_resolution = OracleResolutionManager::fetch_oracle_result(

///     &market_id
/// )? {
///     println!("Successfully retrieved stored oracle resolution");
/// }
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Oracle Provider Integration
///
/// The manager integrates with multiple oracle providers:
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Address};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::oracles::{OracleFactory, OracleInstance};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::types::OracleProvider;
/// # let env = Env::default();

///         // Pyth-specific operations
///     },
/// }
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Confidence Scoring Algorithm
///
/// Oracle confidence is calculated based on:
/// - **Data Freshness**: How recent the oracle data is
/// - **Provider Reliability**: Historical accuracy of the oracle provider
/// - **Price Stability**: Volatility and consistency of price data
/// - **Network Health**: Oracle network status and availability
///
/// ```rust
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::{OracleResolution, OracleResolutionManager};

///
/// // Confidence scoring factors
/// let confidence = OracleResolutionManager::calculate_oracle_confidence(&oracle_resolution);

///     _ => println!("Very low confidence - oracle data unreliable"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Error Handling and Fallbacks
///
/// The manager handles various error scenarios:
/// - **Oracle Unavailable**: Network issues or service downtime
/// - **Invalid Data**: Malformed or unreasonable oracle responses
/// - **Stale Data**: Oracle data older than acceptable thresholds
/// - **Feed Errors**: Requested price feed not available

/// - **Hybrid Resolution**: Combined with community consensus
/// - **Oracle-Only Markets**: Direct outcome determination
/// - **Dispute Evidence**: Oracle data used in dispute resolution
/// - **Confidence Weighting**: Oracle confidence affects final resolution confidence
///
/// # Performance and Optimization
///
/// The manager optimizes performance through:
/// - **Caching**: Cache oracle responses to reduce network calls
/// - **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple markets efficiently
/// - **Async Operations**: Non-blocking oracle data fetching
/// - **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple oracle providers for reliability
